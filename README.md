# GalleryPack

> Deliver photo galleries fast.

GalleryPack is a command-line build tool that turns a folder of photos into a clean, ready-to-share static gallery.

Drop your photos in a folder, run a single command, and generate a gallery you can publish anywhere, share as a link, or keep as a portable archive.

No accounts. No platform. Just your files, your hosting, your rules.

## ✨ Why GalleryPack

- ⚡ **Fast builds** — generate a full gallery in seconds to minutes
- 🔗 **Easy to share** — send a simple link to clients or friends
- 🌍 **Works anywhere** — deploy on Apache, Nginx, GitHub Pages, S3, Netlify…
- 🔒 **Optional protection** — password (Apache) or private unguessable link
- 📦 **Self-contained output** — no backend, no runtime dependencies
- 📴 **Offline-ready** — works without internet once built

---

## 🎯 Use cases

- Send a photo shoot to a client with a clean, shareable link
- Publish an event gallery in minutes
- Deliver photos without relying on Google Photos, iCloud, or Pixieset
- Archive a project with full metadata and download permissions
- Share photos with full control over files, hosting, and URLs

## ⚡ Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/pvollenweider/ssgg.git
cd ssgg
npm install

# 2. Create a gallery
npm run new-gallery my-shoot
# → creates src/my-shoot/photos/ and a pre-filled gallery.config.json

# 3. Drop your photos into src/my-shoot/photos/

# 4. Build
npm run build my-shoot

# 5. Preview
npm run serve
# → open http://localhost:3000/my-shoot/

# 6. Publish  (requires publish.config.json — see docs/reference.md)
npm run publish -- my-shoot
# → patches .htaccess, uploads, writes DELIVERY.md with the live URL

# 7. Send to your client
#    → copy-paste the contents of dist/my-shoot/DELIVERY.md
```

The output in `dist/my-shoot/` is ready to deploy anywhere.

## 📦 What you get

- **Responsive grid** — 3-column layout with big/small tiles, square-cropped
- **Full-screen lightbox** — keyboard navigation, touch swipe, fullscreen
- **Slideshow** — auto-advance with progress bar, configurable interval
- **EXIF overlay** — camera, lens, aperture, shutter, ISO, GPS location
- **Download** — individual photo or full gallery ZIP (configurable)
- **Legal notice** — auto-generated in your locale (fr / en / de / es / it / pt)
- **Delivery message** — `DELIVERY.md` ready to copy-paste and send to your client

---

## 🔐 Access & sharing

Three modes — choose based on your needs:

- **Public** — simple, predictable URL, listed in the site index
- **Private link** — unguessable hashed URL, hidden from index, no password prompt
- **Password protected** — Apache basic auth, lock icon shown in site index

> Password protection requires Apache. Use `private: true` on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

See [docs/privacy-access.md](docs/privacy-access.md) for the full comparison.

## 🧠 How it works

GalleryPack is a **build tool**, not a hosting service.

- **Input** — your photos in `src/<name>/photos/`
- **Output** — a static gallery in `dist/<name>/`
- **Hosting** — your choice (Apache, GitHub Pages, S3, anywhere)

It does not touch your originals, upload anything without your command, or require a running server.

## ⚙️ Configuration

`gallery.config.json` is optional — smart defaults apply automatically.
When you need it, the full config looks like this:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "title":  "My Gallery",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "date":   "2025-06-01",
    "locale": "en",
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

Common scenarios:

```json
// Client delivery with password
{ "project": { "access": "password", "allowDownloadGallery": true } }

// Public portfolio, no download
{ "project": { "access": "public", "allowDownloadImage": false, "allowDownloadGallery": false } }

// Private preview link (no password prompt)
{ "project": { "private": true } }
```

See [docs/reference.md](docs/reference.md) for all fields.

## 💡 Philosophy

> Your photos, your server, your rules.

GalleryPack prioritises **simplicity, predictability, and ownership** over features.
Smart enough that you never have to think. Transparent enough that you always understand what it did.
