# GalleryPack

**Deliver photo galleries fast.**

GalleryPack is a SaaS platform for professional photographers to build and deliver static photo galleries. Photographers and admins manage content through a web admin panel; visitors see pure static HTML files served directly by Caddy -- no database or server is hit when someone views a gallery.

---

## Key features

- **Static gallery generation** -- photos are resized to optimized WebP, bundled into standalone HTML/CSS/JS sites
- **Multi-tenant** -- run a single installation for multiple organizations, each with its own domain or subdomain
- **Resumable uploads** -- tus-based chunked uploads with duplicate detection and conflict resolution
- **Watermarking** -- configurable text watermark on full-size images using Sharp SVG compositing
- **Role-based access control** -- four-level permission model (platform, organization, project, gallery)
- **Private galleries** -- password-protected or token-based access with revocable viewer tokens
- **Internationalization** -- admin UI available in 18 locales
- **S3 or local storage** -- works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, or the local filesystem
- **Real-time build progress** -- SSE-streamed build logs with live progress bar
- **Photo insights** -- focal-length distribution, camera stats, and AI-generated lens insights
- **Invitation system** -- invite photographers by email with optional gallery assignment and copyable links

## Quick start

See [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) for full installation instructions.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker compose -f docker-compose.saas.yml up -d
```

## Architecture overview

```
Upload --> Manage --> Build --> Static files --> Visitors
```

GalleryPack separates content management from delivery. The admin panel (React SPA) talks to an Express API backed by MariaDB. A background worker processes build jobs, calling the engine to resize images and generate static gallery sites. Caddy serves the built galleries as plain static files.

For the full architecture description, see [docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md).
